# Weather Jetpack Compose Android application
I created this project to learn Jetpack Compose using NECO RU videos on Youtube.<br>
(see: <https://www.youtube.com/@NecoRuChannel> )<br>

All the data of weather forecast is gotten from <https://www.weatherapi.com/>

### But I improved this using my own ideas: 
- time-requiring work was moved to IO threads using Coroutines
- transparent design of TabLayout, Card and LazyColumn
- random beautiful background every time the user launches the app
- chosen city is saved in SharedPreferences
- using Timber lib for better logging
- code refactoring

### Used technologies: 
- Kotlin
- Android
- Jetpack Compose
- Volley
- Coil
- Coroutines
- Timber
